      <description>Photo taken with the Nexus 5
I received my Nexus 5 today, only six days from when it was announced. The specs are pretty impressive:
 Snapdragon 800 - MSM8974 (Quad-core Krait @ 2.26GHz) 2GB RAM and 32GB storage 8MP Rear Camera / 1.3MP Front Camera 5&amp;rdquo; IPS Display at 1080x1920 (445ppi)  Compare that to my measly Lumia 710:
 MSM 8255 (Single-core Scorpion @ 1.4 GHz) 512MB RAM and 8GB storage 5MP Rear Camera / No front camera 3.</description>

      <description>Today, I made the questionable decision to move off my dedicated hosting and use this github page as my homepage for abshack.com. Unsurprisingly, it&amp;rsquo;s not working. :(
I&amp;rsquo;ve set the host records on the domain and I&amp;rsquo;ve got a CNAME in this pages repository but the page still won&amp;rsquo;t resolve properly.
sigh
After a couple minutes of fiddling around, I decided to go ahead and change the repository name to end with .</description>

      <description>Instead of playing Torchlight 2, as I normally do on weeknights, today I decided to update my github page. As is often the case, the content is neglected while I play around with new CSS or JS.
This time, I decided to use bootstrap to style my page. With a bare minimum of effort (2 hours while watching GSL on another monitor), I made the current style, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t look half bad.</description>

      <title>Getting started with pages</title>

      <description>In preparation of starting my work on Crispy (and documenting the whole process), I&amp;rsquo;m making Github Pages my primary blog. I should start doing some lexing and parsing work this week (should be able to parse arithmetic operations, assignments and conditional statements by end of this week). This is assuming I&amp;rsquo;m not lazy, which is always a dangerous thing to assume.</description>

      <title>Setting up Jekyll on Win7</title>

      <description>Jekyll takes a bit of effort to set up on Win7. I was hoping to just grab Ruby and gems on Cygwin to install it but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out as planned. So here is how I made Jekyll work on Win7 64-bit.
Installing Ruby Grab Ruby Installer from their downloads page. I used Ruby 1.9.3-p0. The install should go by smoothly.
Installing dev-kit From the same downloads page above, download the development kit.</description>
