title: Getting started with pages
---

In preparation of starting my work on Crispy (and documenting the whole process), I'm making Github Pages my primary blog. I should start doing some lexing and parsing work this week (should be able to parse arithmetic operations, assignments and conditional statements by end of this week). This is assuming I'm not lazy, which is always a dangerous thing to assume.
