title: How great is bootstrap?
layout: post

Instead of playing Torchlight 2, as I normally do on weeknights, today I decided to update my github page. As is often the case, the content is neglected while I play around with new CSS or JS.

This time, I decided to use bootstrap to style my page. With a bare minimum of effort (2 hours while watching GSL on another monitor), I made the current style, which doesn't look half bad. Bootstrap has made it easy to prettify barebone and hobby websites. I think it's a good thing.
