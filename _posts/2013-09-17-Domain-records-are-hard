title: Domain records are hard

Today, I made the questionable decision to move off my dedicated hosting and use this github page as my homepage for abshack.com.
Unsurprisingly, it's not working. :(

I've set the host records on the domain and I've got a CNAME in this pages repository but the page still won't resolve properly.

*sigh*

After a couple minutes of fiddling around, I decided to go ahead and change the repository name to end with .io. That seems to have done the trick.

Abshack.com is up and running. :)
