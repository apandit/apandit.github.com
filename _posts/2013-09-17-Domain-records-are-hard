Today, I made the questionable decision to move off my dedicated hosting and use this github page as my homepage for abshack.com.
Unsurprisingly, it's not working. :(

I've set the host records on the domain and I've got a CNAME in this pages repository but the page still won't resolve properly.

*sigh*
